# GarageSeller

Garage seller is the convergence of two subjects I study in more depth recently: ASP.NET Core and Docker
When I decided I had enough knowledge, I set the objective to create an application 
composed of an API and its persistence running in containers. Another mandatory point was to design 
the API with Swagger.

- API.NET Core 2.1
- Entity Framework code first
- Docker
- Swagger / Open Api Specification
