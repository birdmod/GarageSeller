# GarageSeller

Garage seller is the convergence of two subjects I study in more depth recently: ASP.NET Core and Docker
When I decided I had enough knowledge, I set the objective to create an application 
composed of an API and its persistence running in containers. Another mandatory point was to design 
the API with Swagger.

- API.NET Core 2.1
- Entity Framework code first
- Docker
- Swagger / Open Api Specification

Improvements: 
- docker-compose.yml to reveal the sql server express used in prod
- integration of nswag or swashbuckle to expose the swagger ui interface - for the moment, the API specification is provided
